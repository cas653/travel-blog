  	<p>The cliche: "I like to travel." </p> 
  	<p>Yes, almost everyone and their mother would put a check next to travel in the "things I like" category. 
  	I'm no different, but for me it's not just something I say to fall within a romanticized norm.</p>
  	<br>	
	<p>
	The truth: I like traveling more than most. Dare I say, almost more than anyone else I know.  I take traveling for what it is: the good, the beautiful, the bad, the heart-breaking, the grungy, and, of course, the never-ending quest for where to eat next. 
	
	As a 20-something-year young person, my sneaker-wearing feet (see above) have been lucky enough to trek through some great adventures, but there is still plenty more left to be discovered. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>So go forth and ramble on.</p>
